performance when we need to compare or represent values "multiple pissible representations into standard, normal or canonical form, which is useful for comparing different representations for equivalence".

identicals values are represented the same object in the memory
value 1 -> unique 1
value 2 -> unique 2
value 1 -> the same unique 1
